# lisp_interpreter
...well, lisp-ish: syntax: yes, functionality: somewhat.
lisp interpreter in C++, written just for fun

## No Longer Active
This project was a lot of fun, and is a satisfying answer to the question "How much compiler-type problems can I solve with no prior experience with compilers?"  
In the near future, I plan to take one or more courses covering compilers and related topics, and then attack this challenge anew.

### what works:
* tokenization
* basic function argument pattern matching
* addition
* vector construction (called vec)
* get element from vector
* convert to string
* string literals

### somewhat works:
* user defined functions. (implementation is bad. Example: user defined functions may not be recursive)

### todo:
* filter
* reduce
* real user-defined functions
* so much more...
